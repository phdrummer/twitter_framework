# Twitter Data Collection Framework

February 2015

This is the start of a framework for accessing data from Twitter's
REST and Streaming APIs. It comes with several example applications
that demonstrate how to make use of the framework.

## Installation

To install the framework:

1. Download the archive.
2. cd into twitter_framework
3. bundle install
4. There is no step 4.

## Assumptions

The above installation instructions assume that you have Ruby 2.X.X
installed and that you also have Bundler installed and that the
`bundle` command is on your path.

## Property Files

Each of the included applications has a required command-line
argument `-p` (short for `--props`) which takes the name of a
file that contains a consumer key and user access token generated
by <https://dev.twitter.com/>. The format of the file is the
following:

```Javascript
{
  "consumer_key"    : "<consumer_key_goes_here>",
  "consumer_secret" : "<consumer_secret_goes_here>",
  "token"           : "<access_token_goes_here>",
  "token_secret"    : "<access_token_secret_goes_here>"
}
```

To get these values, head to <https://dev.twitter.com/> and click
on the link that says *Manage Your Apps*.


## Have Fun!

You can now try out some of the command-line programs that come with
the framework such as get_tweets.rb or find_tweets.rb. Most of these
apps behave similarly. Invoke one with the `--help` flag to get
a feel for how they work.

If you have any questions, send them to Prof. Ken Anderson of the
Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.
